 ## Requirements
 OpenToonz 1.0 is necessary for loading scenes.
 And some requirement as follows:
  - AzPainter2 to load *.apd files (Background drawings)
  - Adobe Photoshop CC 2016 to load *.psd files (Background drawings)
  
 ## Install
 Clone repository or download files. And copy for your OpenToonz stuff folder. Default location of OpenToonz stuff folder is "C:\OpenToonz 1.0 stuff".
 
 ### Path problem(Fixed!!)
 ~~We had been put stuff folder at sharing folder. The original path is "\\winty\Product04\OpenToonz 1.0 stuff". All scene includes this path. You should change path to your location.
 OpenToonz scene files are included at "\projects\S1\scenes", which are plane XML document. You can replace path easily using some text replacing tools (Ex. \\\\winty\\Product04\\ to c:\\)~~
 
 ~~If you want to change scene files using OpenToonz, you should do right-click red-showed level, and open level settings. You can change path in this window.~~
